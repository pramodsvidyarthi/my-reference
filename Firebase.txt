Its a key-value pair db not a relational or document based db.

set - to insert new children into the db, can nest upto 32 levels. if EXISTS will OVERWRITE.

post - generate a uniqueid for each object we wish to create.

use best practices of logging errors .

use orderByChild before using startAt and endAt thats wen the query runs successfully else returns null.

use orderByChild, to order the children and orderByKey to order upon the keys. Also setWithPriority to set priority.

priority is used to provide a custom ordering for the children at a location (if no priorities are specified, the children are ordered by name). 

documentation is good be patient and analyze and understand well..

vvimp: If no orderBy is used before startAt or endAt it will not show up.

 key : value
(key)  (children)


orderByKey must have a argument i.e name (below john and derrick) if they have to be chained with startAt and endAt. else can use orderBykey without startAt and endAt.
eg:  'john':{
	 appeared: 
	 height: 
	 length: 
	 order: 
	 vanished: 
	 weight: 
     },
     'derrick':{
	 appeared: 
	 height: 
	 length: 
	 order: 
	 vanished: 
	 weight: 
     }
